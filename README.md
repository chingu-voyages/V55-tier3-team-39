# Dinowars Project

## Description

This project ended as an exploration of technologies and designs for a website about the [Bones Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars).

The project was originally inspired by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) format and intention. Another source of inspiration was the ["Cancelled" demo](https://www.framer.com/gallery/cancelled) by Ariella Delin.

> Bear in mind that this project is very far from achieving the level of quality and refinement as the projects that inspired it

During the exploration there were several frameworks that were on the repository as now deleted branches. Those included technologies like:
- vanilla JS
- nuxt.js / vue.js
- next.js / react.js
- astro / svelte, and
- sveltekit

Other technologies in use were:
- [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [konva](https://konvajs.org/)
- [scrollmagic](https://scrollmagic.io/)

The objective was to select a tech stack on which to focus for further development. In fact, this project is still in progress and will continue its development in a forked repository.

In order to close this repository I kept only the code that might guide the future design, which is what I partially achieved during the Voyage.

> Be aware that the code is sometimes incomplete and might not work as expected. If in doubt, try to refresh and / or scrolling to see if the behaviour improves.

The project showed here is in vanilla JS and CSS. It was done so for quick development and PoC and it was not meant as final product.

Some of the images that will be used in further developments are also shown.

## Next Steps and Expected Developments

As next steps, the plan is:
- revise the use of some of the JS libraries
- improving the design
- translating the design and the code into the selected stack ([sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction))
- make use of a headless CMS to work part of the content; for that I would use [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
