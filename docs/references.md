Cope --- 1976 --- Calendron Beds (Texas)
Marsh --- 1877-1886 --- Note from A. Lakes (Denver) quarry of discoveries in Morrison (Colorado) <Atlantosaurus>
Cope --- 1877-1886 --- same than above, but late to the negotiation
Cope --- 1877-1886 --- Negotiated with Lucas, Canyon City (Colorado) <Camarasaurus>
Cope / Marsh --- 1877-1886 --- Garden Park (Colorado) 
(SIMILAR COORDS TO Canyon City)
Contested Site: Joseph Felch supplied both Cope and Marsh at different times.

Cope --- 1877 --- Como Bluff (Wyoming)
Williston (Marsh) -- 1877 -- from Kansas to Morrison then to Como Bluff, after being informed by rail workers (Reed and Carlin) (Wyoming) <Diplodocus>
Cope eventually loses grip over the Como Bluff area

Both exploited the area for long until 1886, Marsh being more successful (more diggers, assistants, money, etc)

Cretaceous

old western typography google fonts
1800 newspaper typography google fonts

To find Google Fonts that evoke the look of 1800s newspaper typography, you can explore several options. Fonts that are reminiscent of early 19th-century newspaper styles include those inspired by sans-serifs, Old English styles, or those that feature decorative elements like wood type. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Sans-Serif and Grotesque Fonts:
Archivo:
This font is a modern take on late 19th-century American typefaces, designed for headlines and highlights. 
Poiret One:
This font has a geometric, Art Deco style, suitable for headlines and short texts. 
Antic Didone:
A sans-serif with a strong, geometric feel, suitable for headlines and display text. 
2. Old English and Gothic Styles:
IM Fell: A typeface inspired by 19th-century European hymn books, featuring an elegant and formal style. 
Garamond: A classic Old Style serif, often used in newspaper typesetting and other print media. 
Unifraktur Maguntia: A fancy display font inspired by German 19th-century foundries. 
3. Decorative and Wood Type Inspirations:
Brim Narrow: Inspired by antique wood and chromatic type from the 1800s. 
Smythe: A mashup of "Arts and Crafts" and "Art Deco" styles from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
Applewood Alternate Font: Features a handmade and vintage look with distinctive imperfections. 
4. Modern Interpretations of Classic Styles:
Domine:
A modern serif with elements reminiscent of Cheltenham and Clearface, suitable for body text. 
Noticia Text:
A humanist slab serif designed for digital newspapers, with a large x-height and ample proportions. 
Tips for Finding Fonts:
Use keywords: Search Google Fonts using terms like "Old English," "Gothic," "Blackletter," "Arts and Crafts," "Art Deco," or "Victorian". 
Explore different categories: Look beyond just the "Serif" and "Sans-Serif" categories. 
Consider the context: Think about what kind of text you're using the font for (headlines, body text, etc.) and choose a font that fits.

#### Haddonfield, New Jersey 1868

The "Bone Wars" in paleontology, a fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, had significant roots in New Jersey, specifically in Haddonfield. In 1868, Cope invited Marsh to a fossil quarry in Haddonfield, but Marsh secretly made an agreement with the quarry owner to have all future discoveries sent to him, effectively barring Cope from the site. This act, according to Cope, marked the beginning of their intense competition and the "Bone Wars". According to www.levins.com, Haddonfield is where the "Bone Wars" began and where Cope and Marsh competed to find and document dinosaur fossils.
