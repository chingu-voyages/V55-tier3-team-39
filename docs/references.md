#### Haddonfield, New Jersey 1868

The "Bone Wars" in paleontology, a fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, had significant roots in New Jersey, specifically in Haddonfield. In 1868, Cope invited Marsh to a fossil quarry in Haddonfield, but Marsh secretly made an agreement with the quarry owner to have all future discoveries sent to him, effectively barring Cope from the site. This act, according to Cope, marked the beginning of their intense competition and the "Bone Wars". According to www.levins.com, Haddonfield is where the "Bone Wars" began and where Cope and Marsh competed to find and document dinosaur fossils.
